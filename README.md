Hi, I'm @L34nW4lk3r, I'm from Argentina and I'm starting to study programming (with the goal of being a Full Stack Developer).
I am currently using FreeCodeCamp and according to my research, the most recommended then is The Odin Project to affirm knowledge.
Wish me luck and follow me while I'm going to upload some projects that I complete throughout my studies.
